# Corne v3 Keyboard Layout

This is the keyboard layout for the Corne v3 keyboard, programmed using QMK firmware. It uses home row mods to accomodate for keyboard shortcuts but you can definitey remove it if you want to. I use the alt gr layer (Right alt) to type in French characters.

## Upcoming changes 

* Decrease the shift timing by 10 ~ 20 ms so that it fires up faster;
* Moving the dedicated shift to the left thumb and move the Enter key somewhere else;
* Putting some of my most used symbols in the base layer
